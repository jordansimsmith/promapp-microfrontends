# Promapp microfrontends

This repository contains examples and proof of concepts of the microfronted architecture, for potential use for Nintex Promapp.

- [basic-example](/basic-example/) contains a distributed applicaiton using webpack module federation, allowing for static registration of microfrontends. Microfrontend implementaitons are framework agnostic.
- [dynamic-registration-example](/dynamic-registration-example/) contains a distributed application using webpack module federation, allowing for dynamic registration of microfrontends and loosely coupled routing.
